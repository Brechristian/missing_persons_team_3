<h2>Human Trafficking in Our Communities</h2>
<p>
  <em>Human trafficking</em>-- most of us have heard of it, but always think of
  it as an issue that only takes place in other countries. We think, "that's too
  bad, I hope they find that poor woman/man", and go back to our normal lives
  never realizing that it is a real problem that affects our local communities.
  The truth is that human trafficking is present all around the world and is the
  second most profitable source of transnational crime, with about $32 billion a
  year being exchanged. Human trafficking comes in different forms, with the
  most common being forced labor and sexual exploitation. Human trafficking is
  often a hidden crime as victims face many roadblocks to getting help such as
  threats from their traffickers, language barriers, and fear of deportation or
  legal action.

<h3>How can I recognize and help prevent human trafficking?</h3>
<p>
  First of all, one needs to recognize that human traffickers do not
  discriminate. Although many times victims come from vulnerable circumstances
  such as poverty, unemployment, homelessness, youth or immigrant populations,
  any person regardless of race, gender, age, or socioeconomic status. One of
  the best ways to help prevent human trafficking is what you are doing now--
  educating yourself about this issue to raise awareness. Programs in schools
  and communities work toward this same goal as well. Identifying victims can be
  achieved through screening tools used in social services, educational
  facilities, and medical settings. Outside of these settings however, keeping
  an eye out for someone who looks timid, scared, has bruises, has had sudden
  dramatic changes in behavior, or suddenly seems disconnected from family,
  friends, and usual activities can help you identify someone who could be a
  victim of human trafficking.

<h3>Human Trafficking in Utah</h3>
<p>
  The most common form of human trafficking here in Utah is sex trafficking,
  with the most common venues being massage/spa businesses, the pornography
  industry, hotel or motel based trafficking, or trafficking based through
  online advertisements. Apart from sex trafficking, labor trafficking also
  takes place here in Utah, primarily in agricultural settings. The 2020
  National Human Trafficking Hotline Data Report for Utah showed that 182 tips
  were recieved throughout the year alerting authorities to potential
  trafficking situations, the majority of which were made by community members.
  Normal people like you and I <em>can</em> and <em>do</em> make a difference.
  Don't hesitate to make a call if you see something that looks off, you could
  be the deciding factor for saving someones life.
